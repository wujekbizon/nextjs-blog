# Hello Network Users aka Participants, Subscribers, Clients.

Today marks the dawn of a new era, and I'm thrilled to be able to share something incredible with you.

> _**Zamieście** - is a village in the administrative district of Gmina Tymbark, within Limanowa County, Lesser Poland Voivodeship, in southern Poland - this is where I live.
> Living in a small village doesn't have to be a problem in today's world. With access to the internet, I can stay connected with the rest of the world and take advantage of all the opportunities that come with it. I'm an avid web user, using the internet for business, networking, and socializing. I share my network with many people from around the world, connecting with them for business meetings, catching up on life, and more._

The internet has become an integral part of our lives, and it is hard to imagine a world without it. It has revolutionized the way we communicate, shop, work, and even entertain ourselves. The web has made it easier for us to access information from all over the world, and it has enabled us to connect with people from different cultures and backgrounds. It has also opened up new opportunities for businesses to reach out to customers in different parts of the world. The web is an invaluable tool that helps us stay connected and informed about what is happening around us. - I'm pretty sure that we all know that and we can agree with that fact.

I decided to become a programmer because I wanted to make a positive change in my life and the world around me. Programming has always been something that I have enjoyed doing, and I believe that by becoming a programmer, I can help shape the future of our world. With programming, I can create innovative solutions to problems and help make the world a better place. Additionally, programming is an ever-evolving field with new technologies and challenges that keep me engaged and motivated.

Today's workflow for creating a modern, fully responsive app with client side and server side components, user authentication, and cloud-based data storage requires a comprehensive understanding of the technologies involved. We need to rely on servers and cloud infrastructure to store our data in an efficient and secure manner, while also ensuring that our application is optimized for all devices. Additionally, we must ensure that our user authentication system is secure and reliable.

Creating an app like that requires a tremendous amount of knowledge and experience, making it difficult for new programmers to get a hold of the entire process.

In today's world, the way we write apps is changing. We no longer need to follow the same old methods that have been used for years; instead, we can use a decentralized approach that puts the user experience first. By utilizing a peer-to-peer network, developers can take advantage of the potential that comes with this new approach and create apps that are more efficient and user-friendly.

Utilizing a peer-to-peer network and cutting cloud services costs is also beneficial for business owners because it allows them to redirect resources that would have been used for optimization towards adding new features to their products. This can help businesses stay competitive in the market by providing customers with more features and better services. Additionally, businesses can save money by reducing their cloud services costs, which can be reinvested into other areas of the business.

During my journey as a programmer, I was fortunate enough to come across a group of highly talented engineers that work at Socket Supply Co. who had found a way to revolutionize the current web. They proposed a decentralized and peer-to-peer approach for future app building, which would allow for greater scalability, security, and privacy. This new approach would also enable developers to create more powerful applications with fewer resources. The potential of this new technology is immense and could potentially revolutionize the way we use the web.

# Remember, remember the 1th of April.

Early today, the one and only JS guru, **[Kyle Simpson](https://www.linkedin.com/in/getify/)** - a mentor of mine and someone I share visions with - spoke at the **[CityJS Conferences](https://www.linkedin.com/company/cityjs-conferences/)** in London about the future and past of decentralizing the web. You can watch his speech **[here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdiXuoMPtUA&t=25014s)**, where he telling A Tale of Two Webs story.

# Conclusion.

In conclusion, the decentralized era has begun and new ways of creating applications are being explored. The use of peer-to-peer networks and **[Socket Runtime](https://sockets.sh/)** as a wrappers for building modern and responsive applications is becoming increasingly popular.

This new approach to application development is more efficient, secure, and cost-effective than traditional methods. It also allows developers to create applications that are more user-friendly and accessible to a wider range of users. Furthermore, this approach can be used to create applications that are more secure, reliable, and scalable. Finally, this new approach to application development is paving the way for a new era of innovation in the tech industry. With the right tools and resources, developers can create powerful applications that can revolutionize the way we interact with technology.
I'm proud to inform that the dawn of the decentralized era has arrived, signaling the start of a revolution.

**_Stay tuned for the 2nd part, where—believe it or not—we will build our first fully cross-platform app using CSA (Create-Socket-App) provided to us by Socket Supply._**
