# 1. Welcome back my programmers !

After a few weeks of break from blogging, I decided that there is finally time to continue with my story.
Don't get me wrong, I didn't stop coding or working on my projects , I just where so busy with that, that I couldn't find time for nothing more.

**My github activity since the beginning of 2023**

![github](github2023.png)

I almost finished building Wolfpad 2.0. The main core it's up and running, there is one or two things left, that needs to be done. New CSS layout is applied and most of responsive design is completed.
Project become massive , and there is still a lot of work that's need to be done , by adding new features, the whole process of registering new client and paid plans.

You can find all of that on my github repository [here](https://github.com/wujekbizon/next-wolfpad)

I decided that I will not share every single file with you guys, you can check that on my github repo if you interested. What I would do instead, is that I will take some main features of my application or problems that I stumbled upon and showcase it. We will learn much more from that. So, let's not waste any more time and let's begin.

# 2. Choosing the right Tech Stack and why is so important.

I need to point this one more time , but this is really important, to understand, that before we even start to write some code, we need to decide, what tools will use for your project.

In this project, we used Next.JS with Typescript and I think there is no better Tech Stack to start a new project nowadays.
Throughout this project, Typescript has been very helpful with catching all the errors. Sometimes it took me longer to figure it out the right type, it frustrated me a bit, but at the end it was worth it.

# 3. Using the power of AI - ChatGTP3

If we like it or not, AI will become a part of our every day life. Sooner or later we need to learn how to unlock it's full potenial. So I decided to start using it sooner, despite the fact that this is still a paid model.

Even if my project was technically 90% of JavaScript, it needed to look good, right, so I decided, that I will spend more time for CSS, to make it looks prettier.

**With more styles comes more images like one of my superhero used to say.**

![spider](spiderball.png)

I don't know how about you, but I don't like to waste time, for looking for cool pictures over the internet , that I can later add to my project. Thanks to AI we can generate them. Most of the images I used for creating Wolfpad was actually generated by AI. How cool is that right!

One of the coolest feature, that I want to implement into Wolfpad, is an AI Tutor. It will be a paid feature, and it'll be using a current generation of ChatGPT3.

Wolfpad is a interactive coding environment. The way, that was designed, is that it's able to understand and write JavaScript, to be more specific - React.js.

So having a possiblility to add a cell with a coding editor , and next to it adding a cell with AI Tutor it's not a bad idea.

# 4. Animations - Framer Motion

In today modern web application, nice effect and presentation is important , so adding right animation is a must.
With help coming Javascript library, that's doing only this, adding breathtaking animation to our web application.

Beneath you can find all the motion animation function that I used in Wolfpad.

```ts
//  motion.ts

import { Variants } from 'framer-motion';

export const navVariants = {
  hidden: {
    opacity: 0,
    y: -50,
    transition: {
      type: 'spring',
      stiffness: 300,
      damping: 140,
    },
  },
  show: {
    opacity: 1,
    y: 0,
    transition: {
      type: 'spring',
      stiffness: 80,
      delay: 0.7,
    },
  },
};

export const staggerContainer = {
  hidden: {},
  show: {
    transition: {
      staggerChildren: 0.5,
      delayChildren: 0.5,
    },
  },
} as Variants;

export const textTitleVariant = (delay: number) => ({
  hidden: {
    y: 50,
    opacity: 0,
  },
  show: {
    y: 0,
    opacity: 1,
    transition: {
      type: 'spring',
      duration: 1.25,
      delay,
    },
  },
});

export const textContainer = {
  hidden: {
    opacity: 0,
  },
  show: (i = 1) => ({
    opacity: 1,
    transition: { staggerChildren: 0.04, delayChildren: i * 0.04 },
  }),
};

export const titleTextContainer = {
  hidden: {
    opacity: 0,
  },
  show: (i = 1) => ({
    opacity: 1,
    transition: { staggerChildren: 0.1, delayChildren: i * 0.1 },
  }),
};

export const textVariant = {
  hidden: {
    opacity: 0,
    y: 20,
  },
  show: {
    opacity: 1,
    y: 0,
    transition: {
      type: 'tween',
      ease: 'easeIn',
    },
  },
};

export const fadeIn = (
  direction: string,
  type: string,
  delay: number,
  duration: number
) => ({
  hidden: {
    x: direction === 'left' ? 100 : direction === 'right' ? -100 : 0,
    y: direction === 'up' ? 100 : direction === 'down' ? -100 : 0,
    opacity: 0,
  },
  show: {
    x: 0,
    y: 0,
    opacity: 1,
    transition: {
      type,
      delay,
      duration,
      ease: 'easeOut',
    },
  },
});

export const zoomIn = (delay: number, duration: number) => ({
  hidden: {
    scale: 0,
    opacity: 0,
  },
  show: {
    scale: 1,
    opacity: 1,
    transition: {
      type: 'tween',
      delay,
      duration,
      ease: 'easeOut',
    },
  },
});

export const slideIn = (
  direction: string,
  type: string,
  delay: number,
  duration: number
) => ({
  hidden: {
    x: direction === 'left' ? '-150%' : direction === 'right' ? '100%' : 0,
    y: direction === 'up' ? '100%' : direction === 'down' ? '100%' : 0,
  },
  show: {
    x: 0,
    y: 0,
    transition: {
      type,
      delay,
      duration,
      ease: 'easeOut',
    },
  },
});

export const titleVariants = (direction: string, rotate = 0) => ({
  hidden: {
    x: direction === 'left' ? '-100%' : '100%',
    rotate: 120,
  },
  show: {
    x: 0,
    rotate: rotate,
    transition: {
      type: 'spring',
      duration: 1.8,
      delay: 0.5,
    },
  },
});

export const footerVariants = {
  hidden: {
    opacity: 0,
    y: 50,
    transition: {
      type: 'spring',
      stiffness: 300,
      damping: 140,
    },
  },
  show: {
    opacity: 1,
    y: 0,
    transition: {
      type: 'spring',
      stiffness: 80,
      delay: 0.5,
    },
  },
};
```

This is an example of animation that I implemented in Hero section. The rest kind of look very similar except that, I'm using different motion functions.

```tsx
// Hero.tsx

import styles from './Hero.module.css';

import { motion } from 'framer-motion';
import { staggerContainer, textTitleVariant, slideIn } from '../utils/motion';

const Hero = () => {
  return (
    <section className={styles.hero_wrapper}>
      <motion.div
        variants={staggerContainer}
        initial="hidden"
        whileInView="show"
        viewport={{ once: false, amount: 0.25 }}
        className={styles.hero_container}
      >
        <div className={styles.hero_title}>
          <motion.h1 variants={textTitleVariant(1.1)}>Wolfpad</motion.h1>

          <motion.h2 variants={textTitleVariant(1.2)}>
            Interactive Coding Enviorment
          </motion.h2>
        </div>
        <motion.div
          variants={slideIn('left', 'tween', 0.3, 1)}
          className={styles.image_motion}
        >
          <div className={`${styles.image_container} submenu-gradient`} />
          <img src="/images/chatpc.png" alt="code" className={styles.image} />
        </motion.div>
      </motion.div>
    </section>
  );
};

export default Hero;
```
